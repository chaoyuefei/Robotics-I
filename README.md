# Robotics I Supporting Repository

This repo contains materials supporting the Robotics I project.

## Structure 

```bash
.
├── forward-kinematics
└── project-mara
```

Currently, there are two sub folders:

- forward-kinematics: simple Python scripts display FK-related content.
- project-mara: supporting materials for mara robot and group project

## Submission
Dear students,

Please read the following instructions carefully to ensure your Robotics I project is submitted and presented correctly. 

Your project report must be no longer than 15 pages and is due by midnight on May 27th 2025. 

It should:
- describe the task you tackled,
- detail all calculations performed,
- include your validation case demonstrating your algorithm’s performance.

Along with the **written report**, please submit a demonstration **video** and your complete source **code**. If your files are too large to email directly, you may use WeTransfer, Dropbox, OneDrive, or another file‐sharing service. Send the download link to mohayad.abdelmonim.mahmoud.omer@vub.be and chaoyue.fei@vub.be, and be sure to add Professor Michaël Van Damme (michael.vandamme@vub.be) in CC.

We expect a clear motivation for your approach, sound technical and theoretical reasoning, and a well-documented codebase. Please use the latex template and make sure you **list the roles** of each of the team members at the end of the document.

**Presentations** will be held on May 30th 2025, starting at 9 AM in the AI Experience Lab (Pleinlaan 9, Floor –1, Marvin Room). You will receive the exact timing for your group on May 28th after you submit your report. Each group has 15 minutes to present and 15 minutes for questions. Be prepared to defend every decision and calculation from your project.
Finally, the GitHub repository contains the slides we used during the practical sessions. Feel free to review them as you prepare your presentation. 
Note:  This email does not apply to retake students who arranged at the start of the semester to retain last year’s project mark; if that applies to you, you may ignore it.

Kind regards,

Mohayad and Chaoyue
